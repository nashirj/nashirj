### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ I’m currently:

  - working on an undergraduate thesis that explores the use of vision and deep learning to learn how to play jazz drums
  - working on building an [automatic chessboard with a custom chess AI](https://github.com/ucfai/knightros-gambit)
<!--   - a student living in Orlando, FL and attending [UCF](https://www.ucf.edu/) -->

- 🔨 My past work experience includes internships at:
  - [@google](https://github.com/google), where I worked on image/video search and backend Maps
  - [@nasa](https://github.com/nasa), where I worked on software development, robotics, machine learning, sensing, controls, and more

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about:
  - reinforcement learning, through reading [Sutton and Barto's book](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and following along with [DeepMind's](https://deepmind.com/) [RL Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDVH599EItlEWsUOsJbAodm)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are:
  - for social good
  - an opportunity to learn
  - technically interesting

- 📆 Past projects I'm proud of:
  - a data processing/machine learning pipeline for LiDAR point cloud data built as a part-time intern at NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) under the direction of James Mackinnon
  - a [ride-sharing iPhone application for college students](https://github.com/tanjyy/ridesio) using `Swift` with [@tahaafzal5](https://github.com/tahaafzal5) and [@yaosarayin](https://github.com/yaosarayin)
  - a web app called [climbr](https://github.com/nashirj/climbr) that stores routes for the climbing wall I built in my backyard during quarantine
