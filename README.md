### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently:
  - a student at [UCF](https://www.ucf.edu/)
  - working on a paper about a mass estimation model created for a [NASA Kennedy Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html) lunar excavation robot

- ðŸ”¨ My past work experience includes internships at:
  - [@google](https://github.com/google), where I worked on a team that supports image/video search
  - [@nasa](https://github.com/nasa), where I worked on software development, robotics, machine learning, sensing, controls, and more

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
  - distributed systems by reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net)
  - machine learning through [Andrew Ng's coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are:
  - for social good
  - an opportunity to learn
  - technically interesting

- ðŸ“† Past projects I'm proud of:
  - a data processing/machine learning pipeline for LiDAR point cloud data built as a part-time intern at NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) under the direction of James Mackinnon
  - a [ride-sharing iPhone application for college students](https://github.com/tanjyy/ridesio) using `Swift` with [@tahaafzal5](https://github.com/tahaafzal5) and [@yaosarayin](https://github.com/yaosarayin)
  - a web app called [climbr](https://github.com/nashirj/climbr) that stores routes for the climbing wall I built in my backyard during quarantine

- ðŸ“š Publications:
  - [Mass Inferencing Model Creation And Deployment To Lunar Excavation Robot, RASSOR](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210011226)
  - [Machine Learning for Dynamical Modeling of a Flexible Inverted Pendulum System](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004568)
