### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working:
  - as a SWE in NYC

- ðŸ”¨ My past work experience includes internships at:
  - [@google](https://github.com/google), where I worked on image/video search and backend Maps
  - [@nasa](https://github.com/nasa), where I worked on software development, robotics, machine learning, sensing, controls, and more

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
  - reinforcement learning, through reading [Sutton and Barto's book](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and following along with [DeepMind's](https://deepmind.com/) [RL Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDVH599EItlEWsUOsJbAodm)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are:
  - for social good (I'm most passionate about addressing problems related to climate change)
  - an opportunity to learn
  - technically interesting

- ðŸ“† Past projects I'm proud of:
  - an [automatic chessboard with a custom chess AI](https://github.com/ucfai/knightros-gambit)
  - a data processing/machine learning pipeline for LiDAR point cloud data built as a part-time intern at NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) under the direction of James Mackinnon
  - a [ride-sharing iPhone application for college students](https://github.com/tanjyy/ridesio) using `Swift` with [@tahaafzal5](https://github.com/tahaafzal5) and [@yaosarayin](https://github.com/yaosarayin)
  - a web app called [climbr](https://github.com/nashirj/climbr) that stores routes for the climbing wall I built in my backyard during quarantine

- ðŸ“š Publications:
  - [Mass Inferencing Model Creation And Deployment To Lunar Excavation Robot, RASSOR](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2021-4216)
  - [Towards Autonomous Lunar Resource Excavation via Reinforcement Learning](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2021-4217)
  - [Machine Learning for Dynamical Modeling of a Flexible Inverted Pendulum System](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004568)
